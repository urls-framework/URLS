# Guides - Manual Installation
**Note:** We suggest that you install using the `urls_install.php` file as it is easy to configure the URLS Framework incorrectly with manual installation. Instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/urls-framework/URLS/blob/main/guides/INSTALL.md).
1. Download the following files: [URLS/src/update.php](https://github.com/urls-framework/URLS/blob/main/src/update.php) and [URLS/src/Urls.php](https://github.com/urls-framework/URLS/blob/main/src/Urls.php).
2. Create a file you would like to use as your settings file and fill it with a minimum of the following (fill in the blanks):
   ```PHP
   <?php
   include '(the Urls.php file)';
   Urls::$base = '(the directory this is installed in)';
   
   // Create your paths here
   
   ?>
   ```
3. Create a `.htaccess` file in the base directory and fill it with the following (fill in the blanks):
   ```
   # --URLS BEGIN--
   # The following lines between \"--URLS BEGIN--\" and \"--URLS END--\" are
   # automatically generated by the URLS framework. These lines should
   # not be edited as it may result in unwanted behavior of the site. Any
   # edits made may be overwritten automatically.
   Options +FollowSymLinks\nRewriteEngine On
   RewriteBase (the directory this is installed in)
   RewriteRule ^(the name of your settings file regex encoded)$ - [L]
   # --URLS ADD_COND BEGIN--
   # --URLS ADD_COND END--
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d [OR]
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f [OR]
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} \.php$
   RewriteRule . (the name of your settings file regex encoded) [L]
   RewriteRule ^$ (the base directory followed by the settings file name) [L]
   # --URLS END--
   ```
   Here is a complete example:
   ```
   # --URLS BEGIN--
   # The following lines between "--URLS BEGIN--" and "--URLS END--" are
   # automatically generated by the URLS framework. These lines should
   # not be edited as it may result in unwanted behavior of the site. Any
   # edits made may be overwritten automatically.
   Options +FollowSymLinks
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteBase /blog/
   RewriteRule ^settings\.php$ - [L]
   # --URLS ADD_COND BEGIN--
   # --URLS ADD_COND END--
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f [OR]
   RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} \.php$
   RewriteRule . /blog/setting.php [L]
   RewriteRule ^$ /blog/settings.php [L]
   # --URLS END--
   ```
