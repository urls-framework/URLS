# Guides - Install
1. Download and open the `urls_welcome.php` file in your browser.
2. Enter a base url. The base url is the path from your servers public directory (usally `public_html` or `htdocs`) to where you want the framework to be installed. It should begin and end in a `/`. If the base directory is the root of the public directory, then enter one `/`. For example, if your public directory is `htdocs` and you want to install the framework at `/htdocs/blog/` then you should enter in `/htdocs/blog/`, but if you want to install it in `htdocs`, then you should just enter `/`.
3. Enter the name of the settings file you want to use. This file will be auto generated in the directory that you installed the framework in. Do not enter in any path information. Just enter the name of the file. If the file does not exist, then it will be created. **BEWARE: IF THE FILE SELECTED ALREADY EXISTS, IT WILL BE OVERWRITTEN!!!**
4. Start makeking your urls! For a more complete example see guides/INSTALL.md.
